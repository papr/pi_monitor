To use Pupil Invisible Monitor app, please note the following: 
- Pupil Invisible Monitor app and Pupil Invisible Companion devices need to be connected to the **same WiFi** network. 
- **Public WiFi** networks often block the required communication protocols and typically they can **not** be used. 
- Some **anti-virus programs** may block the required communication protocols by default. 
- We recommend using a **dedicated wifi router** for low latency and ease of use.

### Using Pupil Invisible Companion

When Pupil Invisible Monitor is able to detect the Pupil Invisible Companion app, you will see a button appear at the bottom of the monitor window. Press the button to connect to your Pupil Invisible Companion Device. You can also press the key of the button's first letter on your keyboard.

The two letters of the button are the first two letters of the name of your Pupil Invisible Companion Device. This way you can easily differentiate between multiple Companion Devices in the same network.
